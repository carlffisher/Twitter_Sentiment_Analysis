@WholeMarsBlog Future wars are all about the drones. Human crews of planes or tanks have no chance.

One exception: a purely analog, human-controlled vehicle is far more resilient to EMF weapons.
@greg_price11 Whoever controls the teleprompter is the real President! https://t.co/1rcqmwLe9S
@ScottAdamsSays @NickCannon We know so little today. I want to know the meaning of life or whatever the right question is to ask, as Douglas Adams would put it. 

Wait ‚Ä¶ are you guys related?

@ScottAdamsSays @NickCannon Consciousness can understand the nature of the Universe. Clams, not so much.
@Andst7 Interesting. Who is behind the bot attack?
@BLKMDL3 @NickCannon Kids are worth it if at all possible. I‚Äôm planning to increase childcare benefits at my companies significantly.

Hopefully, other companies do same.

Also, Musk Foundation plans to donate directly to families.

Hopefully, details to be announced next month.
@sm Agreed, this needs to be addressed
@Liv_Boeree The world has gone mad
@hiromichimizuno Terrible news
@slashdot Great!
@BillyM2k @slashdot That is indeed the real question
@BillyM2k I had same great experience from Tokyo to Osaka
@BillyM2k China &amp; Japan have awesome trains. 

Took bullet train from Beijing to Xi‚Äôan to see Terracotta Army of Áß¶ÂßãÁöá.
Super fired up for future product development with our awesome Tesla team! Such an honor to work with them.
@WholeMarsBlog Also, being ruggedized for relentless salt spray &amp; extreme winds &amp; storms in deep ocean is not easy
@WholeMarsBlog No, it‚Äôs dual, high performance terminals, which are important for maintaining the connection in choppy seas &amp; heavy storms.

Still obv premium pricing, but way cheaper &amp; faster than alternatives.

SpaceX was paying $150k/month for a much worse connection to our ships!
@JoshSeefried A flying, electric boat would be sickkk
Starlink for boats! https://t.co/BQujU8Ngna
@cb_doge Not bad! 

It is high time that the future looked like the future.

Same goes for fashion.
RT @SpaceX: In addition to withstanding extreme cold, heat, hail, sleet, heavy rain, and gale force winds, Starlink is rugged enough to wit‚Ä¶
@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k @tesla_adri Pretty much. A van would have more roof height, so you could stand or sit under it for shade.
@BillyM2k Maybe with an optional solar power canopy that extends both sides of the van, tripling roof area
@teslaownersSV üòâ
@micsolana @rmcentush Exactly
Maybe Tesla should make a highly configurable Robovan for people &amp; cargo?
@PPathole Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated, even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse
I hope you have big families and congrats to those who already do!
Population of Mars is still zero people!
Mark my words, they are sadly true
Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. 

A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.

@itsALLrisky Yeah, they‚Äôre going way too far in squashing dissenting opinions
@WorldAndScience I‚Äôm pro-nuclear, but chart is overly weighted towards it and significantly overstates the mining required for solar. Take it with a big grain of salt.
